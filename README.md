Analyze Boston Crime Data

getdata.R loads the data I downloaded from https://osf.io/zyaqn/wiki/3.%20Get%20the%20data/ (2016-2021) I added a column called year it's easier for us to analyze data by year.

inspectdata.R inspects some data in the whole data set. The main columns are offense_against, offense_group and offense_type. I created a table for different variables and their frequencies.

offensive_against.R creates histograms for offensive against column.
